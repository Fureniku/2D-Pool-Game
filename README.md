2D physics-based pool game. 

Controls are on-screen, an executable is available in the .zip file in the project root.

## Building
Extract "vendor" and place one level above;

./vendor/Box2D etc ...  
./project/cw/[files]...

(Sorry - this is how our lecturer had us make it and we didn't know better at the time!) 

Run buildVS2019Projects.bat to generate a solution file then open in Visual Studio. Retarget solution as needed.
